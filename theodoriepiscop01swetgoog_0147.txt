the context} and even Rab., who in the
text has substitute-d ‘⁴ qnod manifestum ”
[a fusion, perhaps, of the Vulg. ‘⁸ quod
manifestatum ’' with the reading of CJ,
betrays his author's text by retaining qm*
in the comm. (p. 136,1. 7), and by leaving
adsumptus (p. 138, l. 17) unohanged. Thus
the present translation goes to confirm
the inference already drawn from the Gk.
fragm. of Th. de incarn. xiii. (Migne,
P. G. 66, 987), that Th. read os ἐφανερώθη.
At the same time too much weight must
not be attached in this instance to our
translator-’s testimony, since he may have
been influenced in favour of qui by Je-
rome’s authority [on Isa. liii. 1 1, “qui
apparuit in carne ;” but whether as an
exact quotation is open to doubt]‚ or by
local and contemporary usage3 qui is the
reading of Liberatus breu- 19 [cf. Tisch.
ad h. l.], of whom see 1. p. lv.

If Th. read ὃς, he was in harmony
with the Syriae versione (Scrivener, In-
lrod. p. 555), but differet! from both

sent texts of their commentar-ies are cor·

as regards Chrys„ whose comm. asquoted

that word occurs in the catenist's own.

ing ὅς or ὅ as with θεὸς. Notis Thdt.’s
exposition deciaive in favour of θεός either
ad loc. or in quaest. ad Gen. 823 in
Erane'st. i., however, he appears twice
to quote the passage in the form θεὸς
ἐφανερώθη.

Comp. Th. on S. John i. 14: ἰδίωμα δὲ
τῆς ’γραφῆς ἀπὸ τῆς σαρκὸς τὸν ὅλου

point out that the use of σάρξ in reference
to the homo susceptus is a protest against

docetis error, not a eoncession to Apolli-
nanamsm. ·
