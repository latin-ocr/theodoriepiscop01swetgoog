ΟΝ SOME FURTHER CITATIONS FROM THE LATIN
THEODORE BY WRITERS OF THE NINTH CENTURY.

1. ῙΤ was stated in the Introduction (1. p. li), that “ only five
writers anterior to the thirteenth century are known to have cited
Theodore under the name of Ambrose.” The remark needs correction.
Since the publication of Vol. Ι., Ι have found extracts from the Latin
Theodore in the treatise De ecclesiastico cfficiis, attributed to symphosius
Amalarius. This author, whether identical with the chorepiscopus of
Lyons censured by Florus Lugdunensis (Migne, P. L. 119, 71 sq.), or
another AmalariuS, a monk (Sigebert. Gembl„ Migne 160, 567), and
successively deacon (Ademar, Migne 141, 29) priest (Migne 105, 815)
and bishop (?) of Metz (Honor. Augustodun., Migne 172, 230), fiourished
during the first three or four decads of the ninth century. He was
present at the Synod of Aix in 816, and at the Synod of Paris in 82 5,
and was afterwards (as he himself tells us in the Preface to his Liber de
ordine antiphonarii) sent by Lewis the Pious on a mission to Gregory
IV. The De officiis is dedicated to Lewis3 and from the dedication it
seems to have been written after the coronation of Lothair and the,
emperor’s marriage with Judith, but probably before the birth of Charles
the Bald¹‚ i. e. between Α. D. 817 and 823. Amalarius died, it appearS,
about A. D. 836, and Lewis in 8405 and thuS, in any case, Amalarius,
although a contemporary of Rabanus, could not have derived his know-
ledge of Theodore from the commentaries of the Abbat of F ulda, which
are of somewhat later date (1. p. xlviii); nor do the variants offered
by his citations present any general agreement with those which are
found in Rabanus. Indeed it is probable that his MS. was distinct
from the Fulda Codex, and perhaps earlier and of a puter type. Ademar

¹ He is not mentioned in the preface, citas.... Iudith orthodoxae, nobilissimae
which refers to both Lothair and Judith; atque prudentissimae Augustae, salus per
Migne, P. L. 105, 988: “diuo Hludouico multos annoS... Hlotharium gloriosissi-
uita. nouo David perennitas. da principi mum coronatum et fratres eius Christus
Domine uitam. ipsi nouo Salomoni feli· conseruet.”
