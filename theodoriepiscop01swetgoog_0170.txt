THEODORUS MOPSUESTENUS

[v. 9.

illam legem quae naturae posita est ille qui se pietatem seruare
promittit custodire noluerit. incipiens uero docere ab illo loco quo
dixit m'duas honora quae uere uiduae sunt, quales conueniat esse
illas quae sub ecclesiasticorum diligentia habentur, interposuit de
5 illis uiduis quae filios uel nepotes habent. ad quos hoc reddidit, ·
implens illud quod in superioribus minus dixerat; deinde ad
suam recurrens sequentiam, manifeste exponit quales uult esse
uiduas quae et sub regula ecclesiastica et prouidentia debent

haberi, dicens :

uidua eligatur non minus annorum sexaginta.

ante omnia aetatem designandam esse credidit in qua con-
stitutae debent in ordinem recipi uiduarum. quidam uero non
considerantes quarn ob causam aetatem uoluerit significari, hoc

et ipsam legem diuinam, or words to the
same effect.

6. ad suam recurrens αφ] After
the break of v· 4-8, the Ap. now pro-
oeeds to point out who are the ὄντως
χῆραι of v. 3, and how they are to be
‘honoured.’ Cs. Lansranc.

11. ante omnia aetatem] Thpht.=xa1
πρῶτον μὲν ιι-ερὶ τῆς ἡλικίας ἀκριβο·
λινγεῖται.

12. quidam uero, δια] ‘Theyare in error
who found upon this verse any rule as to
the proper age for admission into the order
os deaconesses. For (1) S. Paul cannot
have intended to require in female candi·
dates sor the diaconate a higher age than
he required in candidates sor the priest-
hood and episcopate3 nor (ς) could the
fixing of so advanced a period of lise have
}been necessary as a test of moral fitness.
'His precept refers only to the widows
who were to be enrolled as Church pen-
sioners3 it was requisite that such should
have (1) reached an age when they were
unable wholly to support themselves,
and (2) proved themselves worthy to
receive the Church’s charity.’

Th. possibly refers to the edict of

2 quod (sor quo) H r
11 aetate C (αντ) Ι designatum H*

12 ordine Η 13 haec r
Theodosius (xvi. tit. α. i. ης cf. Sozom.
H. E. vu. 16): ‘⁸ nulla nisi emensis Lx·
annis...secundum praeceptum apostoli ad
diaconissarum consortium transferatur.”
This confusion os the two distinct orders
of widows and deaconesses finds place
also in Pelagius, who remarks ad Ιι. l.:

“tales uoluit elegi diaconissas quae om-
nibus essent exemplum uiuendi.” It is
worth noticing that whilst Primasius
simply repeats Pelagius, Sedulius adds
Th. ’s view as an alternativex “dig-atur,
in ministerium diaconatus3 u el ut sus-
tentatur opibus ecclesiae.”

In earlier Church literature the order
of ‘ widows ’ appears as a distinct body
(umuatus, Tert. dc uirg. uel. 93 ordo
uiduarum, Ps.-C1em. Recosgn. VI. 153 τὸ
τάγμα τῶν χηρῶν Ps.-Ign. Philipp. 15 {cf-
lgn. Smyrn. ¹3 (τὰς παρθένους τὰς λεγο-
μένας χήρας), and Zahn’s note ad l.];
and the distinction was at a later time
quite clearly recognized by the Quinisext
Co. (can. 40: ἐν ’γὰρ τῷ θείῳ ἀποστόλῳ
’γέγραπται ἑξήκοντα ἑτῶν τὴν ἐν τῆ ἐκκλη·
σία καταλέγεσθαι χήραν ol δὲ ἱεροὶ
κανόνες τεσσαράκοντα ἐτῶν τὴν διακόνωσαν
χειροτονεῖσθαι παραδεδώκασιν).
