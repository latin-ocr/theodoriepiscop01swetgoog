APPENDIX A.

FRAGMENTS OF THE DooMATIC WORKs
OF THEODORE.

IN the notes to this edition 1 have had frequent occasion to refer
the reader to extant fragments of the lost works of Theodore3 and where
any of these supplied an important illustration of his commentary on S.
Paul, it has been quoted, sometimes at length. Since the completion of
the first volume, and when the second was abeady far advanced‚ a
German critic¹, to whose views on this subJect great deference is due,
expressed a wish that room might be found in this edition for a reissue
of the fragments as a whole. To have collected and re-edited the entire
mass would have swelled the second volume to an inordinate size,
besides requiring an expenditure of time and labour for which 1 was not
prepared 3 and under the circumstances it has been determined to

reproduce only the fragments of the dogmatic workS, leaving to some
future editor the reissue (if it should be thought necessary) of the
fragmentary commentaries on the Old Testament. To all that survives
of the lost commentaries on the New Testament‚ the work of O. F.
Fritzsche is still a sufficient and accessible guide.

The greater number of the fragments which follow have already been
collected by the Abbe Migne (Patrol. Graeca, lxvi. 966-1920)⁸. In
