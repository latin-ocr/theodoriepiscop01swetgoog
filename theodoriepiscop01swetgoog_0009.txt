PREFACE

THE issue os this volume has been postponed in consequence
of the additional labour· involved in the preparation of Ap-
pendix A. 1 trust that the delay may be justified by the
convenience which will attend the binding up of the Inter-
preter's directly dogmatic utterances with the remains of his
Commentary on ten of the Pauline EpistleS.

I have been compelled to relinquish the hope of printing
a list of variants which Cardinal Pitra had offered to supply
from a third MS. of the Latin translation (cs. 1. XV. n.). The
Cardinal has recently written to express his regret that he is
unable to furnish the information. His withdrawal is the more
unfortunate, as he is not at liberty to reveal the present locality
os the MS.

Among the notices which the first volume has received
in England and in Germany 1 have observed but one which
offers any suggestions for the further emendation of the
text. These criticismS, which are from the pen of Professor
J. L. Jacobi‚ have been incorporated, as sar as 1 have been
able to accept them, among the additions and corrections

which follow the Commentary.
