'348 APPENDIX c,

l. 5 et ut passionem Christi omnibus necessariam esse demonstraret
(fhr et quia...esse), 9 quoniam (for quia et). P. 90, l. 4 ut praedicem
omnibus hominibus (for ut dicat omnium hominum). It will be
observed that the text followed by Rabanus in this letter diverges very
widely indeed from that which he had before him when writing the
commentaries ; unless he suffered himself in the latter to quote memoriter
or with singular laxity.

The Homiliae in Evangelia et Epistolas, which belong to the period
when Rabanus was Abbat of Fulda, and were collected shortly after
his elevation to the archiepiscopal office, have also yielded up three
considerable but not quite continuous extracts from the Latin Theodore
(Hom. xxxvii. [Migne, P. L. 1 10, 214 sq. = 11. pp. 33——3 5] 3 Hom. lxxviii.
[Migne, 298 sq.=1. pp. 299—302]; Hom. xcvi. [Migne, 327 sq.=1.
304—307]). With one exception (Hom. i), these are the only homilies
in the collection which are founded on the Epistles from Philippians
onwards 3 and each of these is drawn verbatim from Theodore, whilst the
greater number of the homilies on Romans—Ephesiam inclusive are
derived in part or in whole from Ambrosiaster. Ι subjoin the variants.
