vi PREFACE.

My acknowledgernents are again due to Mr Bensly, for having
revised the Syriae quotations in the notes and Appendices; to
the officers and workmen of the University PreSS, for their
'continued endeavours to' bring the letter-press to perfection;
and to the Syndics of the Pre53‚ for the patience with which

they have borne 'the many delays incident to the execution
os my task.

For mysels, the work which has occupied the leisure os
the last seven years will have its full reward, if this edition
os one of the most remarkable of ancient commentaries shall

be permitted to lighten in any way the toil of those who are
engaged in the higher labour os editing and interpreting the
Epistles os S. Paul.

Asnnon,
May, 1882.
