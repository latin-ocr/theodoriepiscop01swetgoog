recent date of the candidate’s conversion

, or baptism was made an excuse for his

inability to produce proofs of his fitness
for the episcopal office; whereaS, accord·
ing to S. Paul, it should have precluded
his ordination altogether.

13. examinet, δια] The drist of this

confused passage seems to be as fol·
lows: ‘Three results», S. Paul foretells,

will follow the promotion of a neophyte 3
he will be (ι) elated by spiritual pride,
(2) exposed to the reproaches of non·
Christians who remember his former life,
(3) liable to sau back into his old sins.
One or more of these anticipations may
be said to have been realized in all cases
where S. Paul’s rule has been disobeyed.
Prelates so ordained have invariably
proved to be proud or greedy of gain, or
at least have failed to command the respect

of departure from the Apostolic precept.
The Western Church had few greater
lights than SS. Cyprian and Ambrose;
and in the East Nectarius of Constanti-
nople and Eusebius of Cappadocian Cae-
sarea reflected no dishonour upon the
Episcopate. But these cases, notably
the first tvm, were exceptional (cf. the
79th Apostolical Canon: εἰ μήτι-ου κατὰ
θείω χάριν τοῦτο ‘fluerat—add S. Basil.
ep. 217); if the precedent was largely
followed, as it seems to have been in Th.’s
age and neigbourhood‚ results such as he
describes would certainly have been like·
ly to follow. The waunth of his language
seems to shew that he had himself ex-
perienced the inconvenience of such
irregular consecrations.
