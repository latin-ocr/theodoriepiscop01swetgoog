orders, but he gives no reference to
ancient authorities. According 'to the
later Greek ritual the subdeacon is or·
dained ἐπὶ τῆς ὡραίας πύλης (Daniel, cod.
marg. iv. fasc. ο, p. 550 ; ef. Nede,
Hist. H-E. ch. 1. p. 198, Dict. qs Chr.
Ant. 1. p. 573), whilst the deacon is led
εἰς τὸ ἅγιον βῆμα, (Daniel, p. 552).

1. alii quidem, alii uero] ⁸ The read-
ers and subdeacons respectively’; below
(p. 134, ll. 1, 2), ‘the presbyter-s and
deaconsss

α. intra diatonicum] See vv. 11.
On the diatonicum or diaconium (Du-
cange, 3.·ν.) cf. Neale, II. E. ch. 1. p.
¹9¹ ; Dict. qs Chr. Ant„ s. v. The Greek
shews that whether τοῦ διακονικοῦ stood in
the original or not, Amalarius is right in
reading intra. The Co. of Laodicea had
indeed expressly forbidden the subdeacon
to take his place in the diaconatum (can.
21: ὅτι οὐ δεῖ ὑπηρέτας ἔχειν χώραν ἐν τῷ
διακονικῷ καὶ ἅπτεσθαι δεσποτικῶν σκευῶν)
—a prohibition afterwards adopted in the
West by the Co, of Agde (ΑΛ). 506,
can. 66: ‘⁸ non oportet insacratos minis-
tros licentiam habere in secretarium,
quod Graeci διακονικόν adpellant, in-
gredi, et contingere uasa dominica’·').
But if these restrictions were more than
local and temporary. they must have had
reference merely to the ceremonial hand-
ling of the vessels, and to the use of the
diaconarum at the time of the Celebra-
tion, since the office of the subdeacon

. α infra diaconiam C* infra diaconium C (corr)

required him at other times to enter the
place where the vessels were kept and to
prepare these and the other requisites of
Divine Service for the deacon’s use3 cf.
Balsamon’s note on the Laodicene >Canon
(Migne, P· G· 137» 13⁶9)= μηδὸ γὰρ
εἴπῃς μὴ ὀφείλειν τούτους ἅπτεσθαι τῶν
ἱερῶν σκευῶν...κενῶν ὄντων· αὐτοῖς γὰρ
μᾶλλον οἰκεία ἐστὶν ἡ τούτων ὑπηρεσία.
This was in fact implied in the form of his
ordination; cf. A post. Comt. viii. 21
(πρὸς τὸ, ἐπαξίως ἐφάπτεσθαι τῶν λειτουρ-
γικῶν σου σκευῶν), Conc. Carthag. iv.
can. 5 (“ patenam de episcopi manu ac-
cipiat uacuam et calicem uacuum ²⁹). But
the subdeacon’s handling of the paten
and chalice was merely intra diacom‘cum,
it was no function of his to convey them
to the altar ς cf. Amal. ii.. 11: ‘⁶ sub-
diaconus uasa altaris ad eum [i. q. diaco-
num] defert, ipse uero ad altare.’' Comp.
Hefele 11. p. 313.

3. necnon luminariorum] This is
not mentioned among the duties of the
subdeacon as enumerated by the ancient
authorities. But the Greek office for his
ordination contains the petition: δὸς αὐτῷ
...ἀνάπτειν λύχνον σκηνώματος δόξης σου.
See Daniel, I.c., who notes (from Goar)
that among the Maronites the newly-
ordained subdeacon perambulates the
Charch, and when he comes to the can·
delubrum thrice extinguishes it and lights
it again—a symbol, apparently, of this
part of his official work.
