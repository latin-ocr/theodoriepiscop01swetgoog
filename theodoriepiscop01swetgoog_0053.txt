THEODORUS MOPSUESTENUS

IN EPISTOLAM B. PAULI
AD THESSALONICENSES ΙΙ.

ARGUMEN TUM.

BEATUS apostolus PauluS, postquam primam ad Thessalo·.
nicenses scripserat epistolam, cognouit quod quamquam aduer-
sariorum pertinacia in 'eadem perstiterit· saeuitia, uariis tempta·
tionibus adgressa eos qui crediderant, tamen ad omnia illa aspera
quae isdem fuerant [inlata, uirtute] Dei in fide persistenteS,
superiores omni temptatione fuerint demonstrati. cognouit
uero quod a quibusdam suasi aestiment finem praesenti in·
cumbere saecu10‚ hocque aliqui quasi ab ipso apostolo edocti

3 prestiteret C* 5 eisdem C (corr) Ι inl. uirt. om C* H r [a lacuna fhllows
fuerant in C* (apply) H ] add in lata C (corr) Ι di in (for dei in) C· dein H in C

α. cognouit quod, &c.] ‘This second dore’s (cf. 11. p. 2, 1. 13, note).
Epistle was written in consequence of 5. fuerant [inlata, uirtute] Dei, δια]
information received after the despateh The lacuna in the MSS. (see vv. 11.‚ and
of the first. The Apostle (1) commends the facsimile opp. to 1. p. xxiv.) is, at least
and encourages the saith of the majority, in H, where it occupies the end of a line
of which he had received a favourable and the beginning of the next, sufficient

report [c. i] ς (2) guards against the error
- of supposing the Second Advent to be
imminent, reminding the Thessalonians
that it must be preceded by the revela-

tion οἰ the Antichrist [c. ii]; (3) ad-
ministers a rebuke to the indolent and
disorderly brethren who had refused to
profit by his advice' [c. iii].—Thdt.'s
argument again closely raeemblae Theo-

for two words of fully average length.
Ι have admitted the very probable con-
jecture of the Corbie corrector (cf. infra,
pp. 42, l. 8, 44, l. 7, 48, l. 3), and' have
added, but with less confidence, uirtute
=r13⁸ δυνάμει. Possibly a whole line has
been lost, and the letters di or de re·
present the last syllable of an adjective
or adverb.
