vinces undoubtedly contained for the most
part more than three or even four παροι-
κίαι each3 cf. Conc. Nicaeu- can. 4: ἐπί-
σκοπον προσήκει μάλιστα μὲν ὑπὸ πάντων
τῶν ἐν τῇ ἐπαρχίᾳ καθίστασθαι· εί δὲ δυσ·
χερές εἴη τὸ τοιοῦτο, &eda-arros τρεῖς...
συμψῆφων ὄντων τῶν ἁπάντων,
κ.τ·.λ. Th. is however doubtless right in
asserting that the Episcopate did not sud·
denly reach its full strength, but grew by
a gradual subdivision of the provincial
Churches. Thus S. Timothy was left by
S. Paul in sole charge of proconsular
Asia; but in the age of S. Ignatius there
were already two Bishops in that province
(Lightfoot, Phil„ p. aro), and by the
middle of the second century, as it would
seem, two more sees had been added (ib.
p. 211). If the Angels of Apoc. i—iii.
are to be identified with the presiding
bishops, this increase had begun in the
lifetime of S. John, since Pergamus be-
longed to the province of which Ephesus
was the metropolis. .

1. inpartibus occiduis, &c.] Has this
statement any historioel foundation? No
doubt some of the European provinces»,

up to the fifth century, contained but few
dioceses; e. g. it seems that Belgica 1.
and Germania Ι. had but four each,
the province of Alpes Graiae claimed
but three, Germania 11. but two, whilst
Scythia remained even in Th.’s time un·
divided (Bingham‚ nt. c. vi. Wiltsch‚ 1.
p. 184 sq. [E. 721). An imperfect know-
ledge of these facts may have led our
author to attribute to the general usage
of the West a state of things which was
in fact merely accidental and partial.

4. promouente] = προβαίνοντος (see
Gk.). Of promouere intrans. the lexx.
furnish no example.

sed et per singula loca, δια] See
the Dice. okar. Ant. 11. p. ¹48o; and
with regard to the chorepiscopi, cf. supra,
p. 123, l. 4, note. Probably the appre-
hension expressed at Sardica (ἵνα μή
κατευτελίζηται ’τὸ τοῦ ἐπισκόπου ὄνομα καὶ
ἡ αὐθεντεία) was well founded, and was
entertained, amongst others, by Th. him-
self.

6. et hoec quidem, δια] Α sort of
apology for the foregoing archaeological
excursus. Cf. 1. p. lxviii. sq.
