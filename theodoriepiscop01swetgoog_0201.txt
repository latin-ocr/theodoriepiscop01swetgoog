THEODORUS MOPSUESTENUS'

IN EPISTOLAM B. PAULI
AD TIMOTHEUM 11.

ARGUMEN TUM.

EPISTOLAM Pauli ad Timotheum secundum sensum explica-
turus, argumentum eius ut moris est nobis primitus explica-
bimus, †euidens est enim illud'quod non post primam epistolam
etiam hanc protinus scripserit, sed et nec de hisdem scripserit
locis de quibus primam illam scripserat epistolam. primam
enim scribens dicit: sicut rogaui te sustinere Ephesi ,· ostendens

ὅτι μή ἀκολούθως τῇ προτέρᾳ ταύτην «γεγράφαμεν, μηδὲ ἐπὶ τῶν
αὐτῶν διάγοντι τόπων δῆλον, ’ἀλλὰ μετὰ πολὺν χρόνον ἄγαν·

ι. Epaelrtolam, δια] ⁴Argument- Fron
a comparison of their contents it appears
that the Second Epistle to Timotheus did
not follow closely upon the first and was
not addressed to the same place. S.
Timothy was now no longer at Ephesus 5
S. Paul was on the verge of martyr-dom.
The present letter belongs to the second
imprisonment at Rome which immediately
preceded his death. These Epist les differ
also in their substance. The first is chiefly

occupied with directions for the govern-

ment of the Church; the second consists
of exhortations to courage and devotion,
including a prophetie condemnation of
the ever-growing evils os the latter time,
and ending with certain personal intima·
tions and requests?
