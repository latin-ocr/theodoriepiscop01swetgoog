The general meaning will then be ε ‘the
Ap. would thus give us to understand
that ecclesiastiea offices are not to be
sought excepting by persons who possess
certain qualifications which he proceeds to
point out.’

3. operm autem] Vulg„ ‘⁶ oportet
ergo;'' the other Latin authorities vary
between ergo, autem, and enim. A u·

tem is supported by the Peshito (ea),

and by the Graeco-Latin MSS. F G,
which read δέ.

9. hoc differenter, &c.] ‘These words
have been variously interpreted. (a) The
practice which is commonly based upon
them scarcely needs a serious refutation.
ordination is usually denied to men who,
otherwise ot blameless life, have con-

13 Coisl. 204, f. 197 a [Cr. vii. 23, Fr. 150] θεόδωροσ δέ φησιν·

tracted two marriages since their baptism ς
whilst it is freely granted, without regard
to moral character, in cases where both
marriages have preceded baptism. To
say nothing of the salse conception of
baptismal grace involved in this distinc-
tion, it is clear that such a practice (1)
attacks the principle of successive poly-
gamy which S. Paul elsewhere sanctions
[Rom. vii. 3, 1 Cor. vii. 91, and (α) sails
to secure the object which he has here in
vieW, viz.: the exclusion of unfit persons
from the pastoral office. (b) Better, then,
is the explanation which sees in the
Apostle's mle simply a rejection of all
candidates who have at any time practised
synchronous polygamy or concubinage,
or have in any other way departed from
the strictness ot* matrimonial fidelity.’
illud quod quasi, &c.] The translator
has smrcely comprehended his Greek.
Quasi represents δῆθεν, and is tobe taken
with obseruatur—‘the pretended observ-
ance ot' the Apostle's rule.’ ⁹
