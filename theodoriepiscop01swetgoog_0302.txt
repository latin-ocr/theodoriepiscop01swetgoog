290 APPENDIX A.

sending them to the press again, 1 have not been able in any instance
to consult the MSS. On the other hand the present issue is not a mere
reprint. Something, it is hoped, will have been gained in respect of
arrangement, punctuation, and occasional emendation; the sources are

indicated from which ‘the fragments have been drawn, and a brief
account has in each case been prefixed of the works to which they
severally belong.

1.‚FRAGMENTS OF THE TREATISE ΟΝ THE
INCARNATION.

For the title cf. Cyrill. Alex. ep. 70 (Migne P. G. 77, 342): τὰ Θεοδώρου βιβλία
τὰ περὶ τῆς steropen-{neon Facund. ix, 3: “libros de Incarnatione, aut ut proprie
hoc exprimam minus quidem Latino sed necessario uerb0, sicut a Graecis dicitur, de
Inhumanatione Filii Dei.” Similarly Justinian conf uel. fid. ( Migne P. G. 86, 1021, ἐν

τοῖς περὶ ἑνανθρωπήσεως αὐτοῦ διαφόροις λόγοις). Ebedjesu: ’.ΔὩς-ἐξ ’.ΑΞ-ὧ

Leontius (ap. Mai scr. uet. nou. coll. Vi. 300) ironically entitles the work a treatise
agai-nst the Incarnation (κατὰ ἐνανθρωπήσεως τοῦ κυρίου ἡμῶν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ).

As to the period at which it was written, see the testimony of Theodore himself
(infra, p. 321). It must be assigned either to the earliest years of his episcopate,
or to his previous life at Antioch3 cf. Gennad. de vir-r. illustr. 12: “Theodorus
Antiochenae ecclesiae presbyter...scripsit aduersus Apollinaristas et Eunomianos de
Incarnatione Domini libros xv.” The extent of the work is stated also by Facundus
(ix. 3 “quinto decimo libro quo ipsum totum opus de Incarnatione conclusit ”).

The contents are thus summarized by Gennadius l. c. .- “ostendit dominum Iesum
sicut plenitudinem deitatis ita plenitudinem humanitatis habuisse. docet et hominem
duabus tantum substantiis constare. id est, anima et corpore, sensumque et spiritum non
alteram substantiam, sed officia esse animae ingenita...quartum decimum autem
huius operis librum de...S. Trinitatis natura, et de creaturarum ratione ...quinto
decimo uero uolumine totum operis sui corpus citatis etiam patrum traditionibus con·
firmauit et communiuit.”

Fritzsche (de Th. uit. et scr„ p. 91 sq.) has with some probability maintained the
identity of the treatise against Apollinarius cited by Facundus, Justinian, and ethera,
with the work on the Incarnation. It is certainly remarkable that the fragments
against Apollinarius belong to books iii and iv, the only books in which no frag·
ments remain to represent the περὶ ένανθρωπήσεως. But the coincidence is too slight
to justify the admission os these fragments amongst the undoubted relies of the books
on the Incarnation; and considering the well known fecundity of Theodore’s pen, it
is at least possible that the general treatise “ de Incarnatione aduersus Apollinaristas”
(Fac. ix. 3) was followed by a more direct attack upon the heretic himself. See
below, p. 3¹²·
